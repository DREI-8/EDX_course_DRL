# EDX_course_DRL

Custom notebooks I did for the course "Fundamentals of Deep Reinforcement Learning" by LVx, as the original ones are not available anymore on edX.

There are 4 notebooks :
 - bandit.ipynb
 - Bellman.ipynb
 - policy_iteration.ipynb
 - q_learning.ipynb
   
Here you can find the videos on which those notebooks are based :

 - Introduction :                          https://youtu.be/Shr9duSxyGQ
 - Course Overview :                       https://youtu.be/-MpMLXenfaA
 - Bandit Problems :                       https://youtu.be/sfdIge0Pmw4
 - Epsilon Greedy Agents :                 https://youtu.be/1XfA5T7uhbw
                   (First notebook : bandit.ipynb)
 - Markov Decision Processes:              https://youtu.be/oYBk1QJ5-Po
 - Returns and Discount Factors:           https://youtu.be/3I5xyKuzQxs
 - The Bellman Equation:                   https://youtu.be/mM5MhyrLiOM
                   (second notebook : Bellman.ipynb)
 - Policy Evaluation and Iteration :       https://youtu.be/YjsYV1ORPwY
                   (third notebook : policy_iteration.ipynb)
 - Q-Learning and Sampling Based Methods : https://youtu.be/ZfBa_ycKKMU
 - Monte Carlo Rollouts and TD Learning :  https://youtu.be/R_GKcQdI1IE
 - Q-Learning :                            https://youtu.be/AVR0vQcLCQ0
                   (last notebook : q_learning.ipynb)

I recommand checking the first notebook after watching the video "Epsilon Greedy Agents", the second one after the video "The Bellman Equation", the third after "Policy Evaluation and Iteration" and the last after the last video, "Q-Learning".

I am new to the field of reinforcement learning and I did those notebooks to learn, so they may contain errors and inaccuracy.

Have a nice day ;)
